# H3EKStringDump
String lists for use with the H3EK

When building a cache and playing it on MCC, you may notice your edited strings reverting to their default. This is because as of Season 8 in MCC, some strings are overriden by MCC's files. To get around this, either create a new string in the list or use a new string list - ie, rename `hud_messages` to `hud_messages_new` and it will no longer be overriden.

When saving a new string list .txt file, it must be encoded as UTF16, as seen here in Notepad's save prompt:
